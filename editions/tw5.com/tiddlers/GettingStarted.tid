TiddlyWiki is highly flexible, and there are many different ways to use it. Here we're focusing on using it as a standalone file in the browser, which is a good choice for most users as it doesn't require any special knowledge or tools. For more options you can also run [[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]].

[[Video Tutorials]] are available, too.

Saving changes as described above is quite inconvenient because of the degree of manual intervention that browsers require. The following alternative method is recommended for everyone who is able to use Mozilla's [[Firefox]] browser (including [[Firefox for Android]]).

! Other ways of saving changes

[[Saving with Encryption]] explains how to use TiddlyWiki's built-in encryption to protect your content with a password.

* [[Saving on Android]] with the custom ''~AndTidWiki'' app
* [[Saving on InternetExplorer]] with the [[TiddlyIE]] extension, or via the [[Windows HTA Hack]] 
* [[Saving on TiddlySpot]], a free service that lets you use TiddlyWiki online
