//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.0.0-alpha.14...v5.0.0-alpha.15]]//

This release has several bug fixes and improvements:

* Rename the `<$setvariable>` to `<$set>`
** `<$setvariable>` will temporarily remain as a synonym for `<$set>` for the next few releases
* A saver module for Microsoft Internet Explorer version 10 and above. Clicking save in the sidebar causes the browser to pull up a bar at the bottom of the window where you can click ''save''. You then get a new copy of your wiki in the downloads folder.
* Support for new `tw-close-other-tiddlers` message (eg, <$button message="tw-close-other-tiddlers">close others</$button>)
* Fixed bug when creating a tiddler title starting or ending with a space
* Fixed behaviour of tags editor dropdown when search box is empty
* Fixed problem with interpretation of `fields` and `index` attributes of the TranscludeWidget
* For http://five.tiddlywiki.com, add a tiddler info tab with a link to the static representation of the tiddler
* Improve the popup mechanism so that the tiddler info panel doesn't close so easily
* Make more UI elements extensible via system tags:
** [[$:/tags/EditTemplate]] for the edit template
* Various improvements for working with TiddlyWeb, including:
** Updated control panel
* Fixed the module type names in the internal tab of the control panel
* Improved styling for embedded PDFs
