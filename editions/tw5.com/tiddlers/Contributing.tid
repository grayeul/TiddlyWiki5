TiddlyWiki5 welcomes contributions to its code and documentation via [[GitHub|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5]]. Please take a moment to read these notes to help make the process as smooth as possible.

!! Bug Reports

For effective debugging, we need as much information as possible. At a minimum, please try to include:

* A descriptive title
* A summary
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behaviour
* Context (OS, browser etc.)

Consider also adding screenshots if it makes things clearer.

There's a lot of good material on the web about bug reports:
