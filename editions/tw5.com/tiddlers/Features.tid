* The ability to save changes on almost any desktop HTML5 compatible-browser, with custom apps to enable saving on [[iPad/iPhone|How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file with TWEdit]] and [[Android|How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file with AndTidWiki]], and a cross-platform [[Firefox extension|How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file with TiddlyFox]] that even runs on Android
* [[Bitmap images|Motovun Jack.jpg]] and [[SVG images|UsingSVG]] are first-class citizens alongside text
* Concise and expressive WikiText that generates semantic HTML
* Integrated [[AES encryption|How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file with encryption]]
* TiddlyWiki isn't just a wiki - you can build custom applications with it like this TaskManagementExample
* Familiar user interface elements like <$button message="tw-modal" param="SampleWizard" class="btn btn-inverse">wizards</$button> and <$button message="tw-notify" param="SampleNotification" class="btn btn-inverse">notifications</$button>
* Easily [[import|ImportTiddlers]] content via drag and drop, copy and paste, or browsing for local files
* Clone existing tiddlers (for example, <$button message="tw-new-tiddler" param=<<currentTiddler>>>clone this tiddler</$button>)
* TiddlyWiki is [[surprisingly scalable|Scalability]] to many thousands of tiddlers and megabytes of content
* Try out the <$button message="tw-full-screen">full screen support</$button>
* Explore the [[D3.js visualisation plugin|http://five.tiddlywiki.com/d3demo.html]]
* [[CodeMirror support via a plugin|http://five.tiddlywiki.com/codemirrordemo.html]]
* [[Markdown support via a plugin|http://five.tiddlywiki.com/markdowndemo.html]]
* Many internal improvements:
** TiddlyWiki can now be run under [[Node.js]] as well as in the browser, allowing it to be used as a personal web server
** An elegant [[microkernel architecture|PluginMechanism]], that allows infinite customisation by replacing and augmenting the core modules
** TiddlyWiki5 can directly build both itself and previous (2.x.x) versions of TiddlyWiki from their constituent separate files, without needing external tools
** Run the TiddlyWiki5 [[test suite|TestingMechanism]] from http://five.tiddlywiki.com/test.html
* Last but not least, TiddlyWiki is a rare example of a practical [[quine|Quine]]

The deep internal changes mean that TiddlyWiki5 is not compatible with previous versions, using different plugins, themes and so on. Content prepared for previous versions of TiddlyWiki will need massaging to work properly in TiddlyWiki5. When asking or searching for help be sure to specify TiddlyWiki5 (or TW5).
