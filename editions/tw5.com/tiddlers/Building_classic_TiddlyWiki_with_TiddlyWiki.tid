title: Building classic TiddlyWiki with TiddlyWiki5

TiddlyWiki5 can be used to build older 2.x.x versions of TiddlyWiki from their constituent components. Doing so involves these additional features over and above those used for building TiddlyWiki5:

* The `tiddlywiki2/loadrecipe` plugin, containing a deserializer module which allows tiddlers to be loaded from TiddlyWiki 2.x.x `.recipe` files
* The `tiddlywiki2/stripcomments` plugin, containing a new viewer format for the `<$view>` widget that strips single line JavaScript comments starting `//#`
* The `stripTitlePrefix='yes'` attribute of the `<$fields>` widget, which removes prefixes wrapped in curly braces from the `title` attribute
** For example, `{tiddler}HelloThere` would be transformed to `HelloThere`

! Usage

TiddlyWikiClassic is built from the command line by running TiddlyWiki5 under Node.js. A typical usage would be:

```
node ../../tiddlywiki.js \
	--verbose \
	--load <path_to_recipe_file> \
	--rendertiddler $:/core/templates/tiddlywiki2.template.html <path_to_write_index_file> text/plain \
	|| exit 1
```
